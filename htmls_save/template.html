      <p>A person has a distinguishing characteristic or personal trait that's thought to be, or may be actually is, a disadvantage (a negative stereotype). When this is viewed in a negative way, it is stigma Unfortunately, negative attitudes and beliefs toward people who have a mental health condition are common. </p>
      <p>
      The worst consequence is discrimination. Discrimination might be obvious and worst when it is direct, like making a negative remark about the mental illness or the treatment. It can be unintentional or subtle - someone avoiding you because the person assumes you could be unstable, violent or dangerous due to your mental illness. The worst end result can be disastrous when the person gets influenced and starts judging himself. This doesn’t help at all – instead deteriorate the situation. </p>
      <p>The other harmful effects are – not limited to – the concerned person gets reluctant to seek help or treatment, lack of understanding by family, friends, co-workers or others, in some cases lead to bullying, physical violence or verbal harassment. The worst possible disheartening consequence is, the belief that the person builds up that he or she will never succeed at certain challenges or can’t improve the situation – which results in demotivating mindset.  </p>
      <p>Stigma doesn't just come from others always – it can be you, who is harming yourself unknowingly. Don’t start believing that your condition is a sign of your weakness or don’t be under the wrong impression that you can handle it yourself without any help. Don’t isolate yourself – that doesn’t help. Talk. Talk. Talk. You are not an illness. Don’t say “I am bipolar” or “I am schizophrenic” - instead say “I have bipolar” or similarly “I have schizophrenia” So speak out please. There is help somewhere waiting for you. </p>
      <p>Others' judgments almost always stem from a lack of understanding rather than information based on facts. Learning to accept your condition and recognize what you need to do to treat it, seeking support, and helping educate others can make a big difference </p>

      <p>Selecting the wrong answer on a test is a mistake; not studying for that test is a bad decision. The mistake was something you did without intention; the bad decision was made intentionally—often without regard for the consequence.  </p>
      <p>Whether mistake or bad decision (which one knows as “bad decision”, once the outcome is seen), a person has to live with its consequences till the end of life, live with its memories, live with it as a lifelong companion.

Some might think it in this way – ok, the other person has forgiven me, so it’s no more a mistake – I can forget about it. But is it true? Did the other person really forget about it? Did your school remove the bad grades from your transcript – the bad grades that you got for your bad choice for not studying? This will haunt you forever and that’s why you have to survive with your mistakes, bad decision – whatever you call it. The worst part is, the person sees mostly in every instance in his life, being connected to that “once done” mistake of his and he blames himself for no reason. No words can assure him that - “It’s ok to forget and forgive”. Is this what we call repentance? </p><p>Come out of it - let not one instance in life, spoil the rest of the life - our present, our future. We have only one life to enjoy.</p>

        <p>Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).</p>

<p>When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly.</p>

<p>Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any.</p>

<p>Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy)....<em>Mayo Clinic</em></p>
